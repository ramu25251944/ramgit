VARIABLE:
In java variable is nothing but a container which holds the value and assign the data type is called java variable.
syntax:
type variablename = value;

Variables are divided into three types.
1.local variables------>  local variables are the variables.it can be created with in the main method is called as local variables.
2.instance variables--> instance variables are the  variables.it can be created in the class level.To access these variables to create an object.This is called as instance variables.
3.static variables--> static variables are also called as class level variables by using static keyword. To access these variables no need to create an object is called as static variables.

DATATYPE:
In java datatypes is a different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable is called as datatypes.
Thery are divided into the two types of variables
1.premitive datatype
2.non-premitive datatype

premitive datatype: it specifies data types are byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean.
non-premitive datatype: it specifies data types are string,arrays,classes,interfaces.

byte--->  1byte 
short-->  2bytes
int---->  4bytes
long--->  8bytes
float-->  4bytes
double->  8bytes
char--->  2bytes
boolean-> 1bit

Here 1-byte is a 8 bits

TYPE-CASTING:
In java type casting is when you assign a value of one premitive datatype to another premitive datatype.They are divided into two ways
1.Widening casting--->  it is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to larger size type. double num = int
2.Narrowing casting---> it is must be done manually by placing the type in front of value. ex :  int num = (int) double

IDENTIFIERS:
In java variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
identifers are class names and variable names and method names.
